Kun Zhou is a 1-st year Ph.D student at School of Information, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of [Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNhNacoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). His research interests are in natural language processing (NLP), information retrival (IR) and machine learning (ML), with focuses on sequence representation learning, conversational recommender system (CRS) and their applications in real-world scenarios. He obtained the master degree from Peking University, and bachelor from Hohai University.

Open Source Projects
======
Most of my research work are open-source. Here are some my preferable projects!

* [**CRSLab**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CRSLab)
  * CRSLab is an open-source toolkit for building Conversational Recommender System (CRS). It contains comprehensive benchmark models and datasets, extensive and standard evaluation protocols, general and extensible structure, human-machine interaction interfaces, and is easy to get started.
* [**TG-ReDial**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TG-ReDial)
  * We released a Multi-turn Topic-guided Conversation Recommendation dataset for research on conversational/interactive recommender systems: TG-ReDial. It is a Semi-automatic Annotated Dataset and leverages Detailed User Background Information.
* [**S3-Rec**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CIKM2020-S3Rec)
  * Code for our CIKM 2020 Paper "S3-Rec: Self-Supervised Learning for Sequential Recommendation with Mutual Information Maximization". It is well-formed and has been used by many researchers.
