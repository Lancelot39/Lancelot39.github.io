Kun Zhou is a 1-st year Ph.D student at School of Information, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of [Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNhNacoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). His research interests are in natural language processing (NLP), information retrival (IR) and machine learning (ML), with focuses on **sequence representation learning**, **conversational recommender system** (CRS) and their applications in real-world scenarios. He obtained the master degree from Peking University, and bachelor from Hohai University.

Open Source Projects
======
Most of my research work are open-source. Here are some my preferable projects!

* [**CRSLab**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CRSLab)
  * CRSLab is an open-source toolkit for building Conversational Recommender System (CRS). It contains comprehensive benchmark models and datasets, extensive and standard evaluation protocols, general and extensible structure, human-machine interaction interfaces, and is easy to get started.
* [**TG-ReDial**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TG-ReDial)
  * We released a Multi-turn Topic-guided Conversation Recommendation dataset for research on conversational/interactive recommender systems: TG-ReDial. It is a Semi-automatic Annotated Dataset and leverages Detailed User Background Information.
* [**S3-Rec**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CIKM2020-S3Rec)
  * Code for our CIKM 2020 Paper "S3-Rec: Self-Supervised Learning for Sequential Recommendation with Mutual Information Maximization". It is well-formed and has been used by many researchers.
